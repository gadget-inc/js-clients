# API Client Core

## ⚠️ Deprecated

This package is deprecated in favor of [`@gadgetinc/core`](https://github.com/gadget-inc/js-clients/tree/main/packages/core). New projects should use `@gadgetinc/core` instead.

This package previously contained helper functions and types used to implement each client for each Gadget app. Developers shouldn't need to use this package directly and should instead use their generated client plus binding packages.

### For Gadget Developers

This package is deprecated. Any new runtime functionality should be added to the `@gadgetinc/connection` package in the Gadget monorepo.
