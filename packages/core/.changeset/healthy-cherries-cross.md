Allow priority to be specified in any case

Previously, background action priority had to be specified in SCREAMING_CASE, like `priority: "HIGH"`. Now, background action priority can be specified in lowercase as well, like `priority: "high"`, remaining consistent with other aspects of the Gadget framework.
