# Development environment

We require `node` and `yarn` to exist. If you're a nix user, we have a flake.nix present that installs the same version of the development tools we use for everyone.

# Building TypeScript

- You can run `yarn build` to build all the projects in the repo
- You can run `yarn watch` to start the TypeScript watcher process for all the projects in the repo which will recompile files as you change them

# Prereleasing

It can be annoying to work with these packages via `yarn link` sometimes, so we also support building and releasing the package to a git SHA which can then be installed conventionally in another repo. To push a prerelease, run `yarn workspace @gadgetinc/api-client-core prerelease`. This will:

- build the typescript
- create a local git commit that has just the built artifacts for just the package in question
- push that to the remote git repo
- and log out a version you can then refer to from other repos

# Releasing

Right now we release through yarn. Run

```
yarn workspace @gadgetinc/api-client-core publish --access=public --no-git-tag-version
```

or

```
yarn workspace @gadgetinc/react publish --access=public --no-git-tag-version
```

to push a new version to NPM.
