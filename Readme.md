# API Client Core

This package contains helper functions and types used to implement each client
for each Gadget app.

Note that, developers shouldn't need to use this package directly and should
instead use their generated client plus binding packages.

### For Gadget Developers

After releasing a new version, make sure to update
the `UserlandDependencyVersions` variable in gadget mainline.
