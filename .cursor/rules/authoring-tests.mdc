# Authoring Jest tests

Don't use jest module mocks for testing -- they aren't well supported by the transpilation pipeline.

Don't reset mocks explicitly between tests, we have the jest config to do this automatically turned on so its not necessary.

Don't just skip tests if you can't get them to work, that's unhelpful. Keep working to get them passing, or if stuck, ask for guidance from the user.
